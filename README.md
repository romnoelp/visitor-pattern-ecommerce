# 🛋️ Furniture Shipping Cost Calculator (Visitor Pattern) 🚚  

You are a **software developer** working on an **e-commerce platform** that sells various types of **furniture** (🪑 chairs, 🏷️ tables, 🛋️ sofas, etc.). Your goal is to implement a functionality that **calculates the shipping cost** based on the **furniture type and size**.  

---

### 📦 Shipping Cost Challenges  

Each furniture type has its own **unique shipping cost calculation**:  

✅ **Chairs** are lightweight and have a **flat shipping rate**.  
✅ **Tables** have a **weight-based** shipping cost.  
✅ **Sofas** are **bulky** and require a **distance-based** cost calculation.  

Implementing separate shipping logic **inside each furniture class** can lead to **tight coupling** and make it difficult to add new furniture types in the future.

### 🏗️ Your Task  

Implement a **Visitor Design Pattern** approach to handle shipping cost calculations efficiently.  

✔️ **Ensure that all elements of the Visitor Pattern are present** in your solution.  
✔️ **DO NOT USE ABSTRACT CLASSES**.  
✔️ **You are free to name your interfaces and concrete classes**.  
✔️ **Provide client code that will test your implementation**.  

🚀 **Make it modular, maintainable, and easy to extend!** Happy coding!
